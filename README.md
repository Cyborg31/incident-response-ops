# Incident Response & Operations

This repository contains hands-on experiments simulating real-world operational incidents in systems and cloud applications. Each incident demonstrates investigation, troubleshooting, and resolution of common IT issues.

## Lab Objectives
- Observe failures and performance issues
- Investigate root causes using logs and monitoring tools
- Document actions, resolutions, and lessons learned
- Build practical troubleshooting experience

## Current Incidents
1. **Web Service Down** – Simulated a service outage and restored availability
2. **High CPU / Memory Spike** – Simulated CPU overload and monitored system performance
3. **Application Crash** – Simulated a runtime error in a Python application and resolved it

## Tools & Environment
- Local applications / Python scripts
- CPU/memory monitoring with `htop`
- Logs and terminal outputs for troubleshooting
